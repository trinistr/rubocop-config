# rubocop-config
My Rubocop configuration to be shared between different projects.

This configuration is somewhat opinionated and does not always conform to Ruby style guide.
It will also probably change over time.

Required gems with tested versions (install through `gem install` or `Gemfile`):
- rubocop (1.65.1)
- rubocop-performance (1.21.1)
- rubocop-rake (0.6.0)
- rubocop-rspec (3.0.4)
- rubocop-thread_safety (0.5.1)
